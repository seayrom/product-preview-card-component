## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Media Queries

### What I learned

Built the product landing page successfully to a desktop layout but struggled to make it responsive. Learned how to make the page more responsive with Media Queries.

Know about separating content (**semantics**) from presentation but typed in capitals "PERFUME". Later used css _text-transform_ property to fix it.

Learned how to properly comment out my code.

### Continued development

Focus on the mobile-first approach work-flow and also continue to use media queries to make my pages more responsive.
### Useful resources

- [@Valentine-D3V](https://github.com/Valentine-D3V/Product-Card-Component-) - I completely scrunitized his code after building mine and really loved his mobile-first approach and his use of some extra resets in the stylesheet which helped me to make changes to my code in order to adopt the mobile first approach.
